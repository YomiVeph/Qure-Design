```

```bash
npm install mailgun-js
```

**Option C: Amazon SES (Very cheap)**

```bash

### **Solution 2: Gmail Configuration Improvements**

1. **Verify Your Domain** (if you have one):

   - Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
   - Verify your domain
   - This improves email deliverability

2. **Use Gmail API Instead of SMTP**:

   ```bash
   npm install googleapis
   ```

3. **Set Up SPF/DKIM Records** (if you have a domain):
   - Add SPF record: `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all`
   - Add DKIM record from Gmail settings
